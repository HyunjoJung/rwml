## vendored/

Real-producer files copied verbatim from permissively-licensed upstreams. Only **MIT** /

### `vendored/python-docx/` — MIT

From [python-openxml/python-docx](https://github.com/python-openxml/python-docx) `tests/test_files/`
(MIT License, © python-docx contributors). Real Word-produced `.docx` exercising common structures.

| File | Notes |
|------|-------|
| `test.docx` | general document (paragraphs, styles, sections) |

> openpreserve/format-corpus (CC0) was evaluated but its office corpus contains no `.docx`
> (legacy `.doc`/`.odt` only), so nothing was taken from it.
>
> Excluded by policy: GovDocs1 (redistribution license unconfirmed; almost no `.docx`), the
> maintainer's private real-world corpus (not redistributable), and Apache-POI test files copied
> verbatim (per-file provenance not individually cleared). The legacy binary `.doc` reader is
> validated only against that private corpus — see the scope note in [README.md](README.md).
